# How to run

## Docker (recommended)
Assuming docker is installed you should be able to run this script with
```
docker run --it --rm --name mycoins adc613/mycoins
```

[ Install docker for mac here ](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)

## Git
The other way to run is to clone and cd into this repo. Then simply run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

This method assumes you have python 3 installed
